# Python-K-Means-Clustering
K-Means Clustering Algorithm for Real Data Set of Walnuts, Using Python.

<h2>Python Dependencies:</h2>
<p><strong>Python Version: </strong> 3.8</p>
<p><strong>Python Modules: </strong> Numpy, Pandas</p>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p><strong>walnuts.csv:</strong> A dataset about amplitude and frequency measurements propagated through different categories of walnuts, using a frequency generator.</p>
<p><strong>RT: </strong> Walnuts placed at room temperature.</p>
<p><strong>SL: </strong> Walnuts placed at direct sun light.</p>
<p><strong>DW: </strong> Walnuts dipped in water.</p>
<p><strong>RT: </strong> Walnuts placed at a fridge.</p>
<p><strong>main.py: </strong> A Python script that reads a walnuts dataset, build K-Means algorithm to cluster these walnuts into three categories: Good, Normal and Bad. The results are plotted as dots.
